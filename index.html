<h2>Icon Actions: (Throw Operations)</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Throw:</b> To suspend a drag-and-drop operation, throw the icon against the top or sides of the window by dragging and releasing it. It will throw instead of drop when the speed is great enough (indicated by the icon rotating 90 degrees).</li>
<li><b>Delete:</b> Throw an icon against the bottom of the window. This will send it to the Trashcan. You can access the deleted icons by double-clicking on the Trashcan icon.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Marker Actions (Catch Operations):</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Move:</b> Drag a marker and drop it. It will turn back into an icon. This is equivelant to cut-and-paste.</li>
<li><b>Copy:</b> Throw a marker against the top of the window. A copy will appear there (indicated by an outline) and the original marker will return to it's original location.</li>
<li><b>Abort:</b> Throw a marker again the side of the window. This will cancel the throw-and-catch operation and restore the marker to an icon, at its icon's original position and folder-level.</li>
</ul>
